# Advent2021

## What is this project? 

I am participating in the  [the advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenge for the first time. 
I will be using excel, R and I will use this as an opportunity to get better at python. 

my solutions will be posted here, as messy as they probably will be. 

### How is this usefull to you? 
 
Maybe you are stuck and would like to see how so solve the issue. Be sure to look at files called `clean` if you don't want to see horrors.
